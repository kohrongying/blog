My Journey!
<!-- excerpt -->

# Part 1: Preparing for the Move

## US Visa
### Visa Types
Work - H1-B and H1-B1

### Applying
1. DS-160 (Online form) 
    - Save confirmation page to be printed
2. Submit payment
    - Download the receipt number
    - Make bank transfer
3. Apply for interview slot
    - Attend interview and hand over passport

### Going for Interview
Bring to your local embassy
1. Passport
2. LCA 
3. US Passport Photo (50mm x 50mm square)
4. Appointment Confirmation

Secure facility. Store your phone and any electronics outside.
Head inside, queue for interview. They will take your passport.
Ask you a few questions.

Whole thing took 30-45 minutes

### Being notified for pickup
I got email/sms to pick it up about 1-2 business days after my interview. Blazing fast! 
I was told 5-7 business days.

There are 2 modes for passport collection
1) Pick up (I chose from Chinatown)
2) Delivery (extra $$)

Things to note:
- Visa itself has validity of 12-18 months but mine was 18 months 
- LCA validity is around 3 years
- Need to renew the H1-B1 visa around 6 months before expiry
- What determines your length of stay is not the LCA nor visa expiry, but Form I-94 when you cross US borders


# Part 2: Upon Arrival 

## Immigration
### Documents to prepare:
1. LCA
2. Company Offer Letter
3. Vaccination Letter

I prepared those documents but I did not need to present them to the Immigration Officer. He took my passport and visa and asked some questions about my employment etc. Thank you sir! My I-94 was also ready after a few hours.

### Things to follow up:
1. I-94 (Check that the class should be HSC and Expiry date is correct)


## Social Security Number (SSN)
The SSN is the equivalent of your identification in the US. Need to register for this 4-5 days after arriving in the US.

### Pre-requisites
1. Passport & Visa
2. SSN Application Form
3. Form I-94

## Things to follow up
Once you get your SSN, do not keep it in your wallet. It is super sensitive. 

Update your Bank account information with SSN. Update your HR/Tax related documents. But DO NOT give it over email or phone. Do it in person.


## Banking
### Pre-requisites
1. Residence
2. Letter of Employment
3. Passport / Visa
4. SSN (I didn't have mine)

### To open a checkings or savings account? 
Banks usually open both of them at the same time for you. There is some difference between them but tldr:
1. Direct deposit your salary into Checking
2. Debit card debits from Checking
3. Unlimited transfers from Checking to Savings but max 6 free transfers from Savigns to Checking each month

I don't really understand the rationale of savings as the interest rate is almost negligible - it's a different story if you have a lot of cash in your savings account. 

I opened my accounts on the same day and got my credit card application put in as well. The cards will be mailed to my residence.

### What bank to open? 
Somewhere with accessible ATMs and ease of use? I considered big ones like Bank of America, Chase Bank, WellFargo

## Driving
Firstly, there is no such thing as an __International Driving License__. You have a few choices:
1. Short term visitors - apply for an International Drivers Permit (IDP) and this allows you to drive in all US States for up to 3 months
2. Long term residents - apply for state issued license. This will allow you to drive in all states.

For me, I was told that I need to fulfil certain requirements to get a Virginia issued license
1. Pass a theory test
2. Pass a practical test

This needs to be done within 60 days of arrival. Pre-requisite for the license registration is your SSN as well, so that needs to be kept in mind!

Take note that the requirements differ from state.

### If not getting driver's license, consider this
Driver License is used also as a secondary form of identification. If you do not plan to drive or learn to, you may consider getting a state-issued ID to serve as secondary identification.

### Car Insurance
Remember to check this out if you're purchasing one! Check if that insurance insures your car in all states.

## Taxes
SSN is important for this to start.

Forms to take note:
1. W-9 for bank
2. W-4 for paycheck

## Housing and Accommodations
I stayed in temporary accommodations when I first reached so that I could view the houses I was going to rent.

Most apartments come bare (Kitchen, dishwasher, fridge, microwave, stove). You will need furnishing. 

Things to consider for complete rent:
1. Rental fee
2. Utilities (Water, Electricity, Gas)
3. Wifi

Buy or renting furniture and appliances are options.

## Misc
- Telephone (AT&T, T-Mobile)
    - I went for a Mint Mobile pre-paid plan $20 for 10GB with eSIM. eSIMs can be activated timely once you scanned the QR and is in range of US mobile service unlike physical SIM cards where they need to send it to your residence, especially if you have not found a place to stay.
- Internet / WiFi


I'll be updating this page regularly as I learn more :) 
Look Ma, how much I've grown!
