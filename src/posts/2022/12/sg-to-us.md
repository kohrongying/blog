My Journey!
<!-- excerpt -->

# Part 1: Preparing for the Move

## US Visa
### Visa Types
Work - H1-B and H1-B1

### Applying
1. DS-160 (Online form) 
    - Save confirmation page to be printed
2. Submit payment
    - Download the receipt number
    - Make bank transfer
3. Apply for interview slot
    - Attend interview and hand over passport

### Going for Interview
Bring to your local embassy
1. Passport
2. LCA 
3. US Passport Photo (50mm x 50mm square)
4. Appointment Confirmation

Secure facility. Store your phone and any electronics outside.
Head inside, queue for interview. They will take your passport.
Ask you a few questions.

Whole thing took 30-45 minutes

### Receiving
I got email/sms to pick it up about 1-2 business days after my interview. Blazing fast! 
I was told 5-7 business days.

2 modes - pick up (I chose from Chinatown) or delivery (extra $$)

Visa itself has validity of 12-18 months but mine was 18 months 
LCA validity is around 3 years
Need to renew the H1-B1 visa around 6 months before expiry

## Moving
This is really based on your own discretion, summer/winter clothes, your devices, some dried foods / microwave meals for the first few days.

# Part 2: Upon Arrival 

## Immigration
Documents to prepare:
1. LCA
2. Company Offer Letter

Things to follow up:
1. I-94

## Social Security Number (SSN)
The SSN is the equivalent of your identification in the US. Need to register for this 4-5 days after arriving in the US.

## Banking
Some banks require your SSN as well as an address in order to open an account.

### To open a checkings or savings account? 
A friend told me that banks usually open both of them at the same time for you.

### What bank to open? 
Somewhere with accessible ATMs and ease of use? I considered big ones like Bank of America, Chase Bank, WellFargo

## Driving
Firstly, there is no such thing as an __International Driving License__. You have a few choices:
1. Short term visitors - apply for an International Drivers Permit (IDP) and this allows you to drive in all US States for up to 3 months
2. Long term residents - apply for state issued license. This will allow you to drive in all states.

For me, I was told that I need to fulfil certain requirements to get a Virginia issued license
1. Pass a theory test
2. Pass a practical test

This needs to be done within 60 days of arrival. Pre-requisite for the license registration is your SSN as well, so that needs to be kept in mind!

Take note that the requirements differ from state.

### Car Insurance
Remember to check this out if you're purchasing one! Check if that insurance insures your car in all states.

## Taxes
SSN is important for this to start.

Forms to take note:
1. W-9 for bank
2. W-4 for paycheck

## Housing and Accommodations
I stayed in temporary accommodations when I first reached so that I could view the houses I was going to rent.
I would prefer fully furnished apartments (I know $$$), but it is a hassle for one person to get all the equipment(?).

## Misc
- Telephone (AT&T, T-Mobile)
- Internet
