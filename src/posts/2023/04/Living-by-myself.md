It has been two months since I packed my two bags and relocated to the United States. What a whirlwind of a journey.

I can't even begin to put thoughts to words to bytes. 

Thought Organisation

Work
Challenged
Critical Thinking
Feedback
Ownership

Mental Health
Emotional Agility
Getting out of your head
Physical Health and Mental Health

Independence
Administrative work of working in US - visa, social security, insurance
Renting a place - getting insurance, setting up electric/gas/water, paying rent
Moving 
Assembling furniture
Cleaning, sweeping, mopping, toilet, kitchen 
Cooking - purchasing kitchen items as well as produce / dried foods / frozen foods
Making soup, eating balanced meals, eating breakfast, being creative
Household maintenance - stocking up on dish washing liquid, detergent, wet cloths, toilet bowl cleaners

All the Help I needed
Asking co-workers, other people on housing processes
Calling home to ask how to prepare food
Consulting google

Suffer
Miss home, warm noises
Clean food, how many times I poison myself...
