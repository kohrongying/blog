##### "But, like don't you already have a blog? Why are you creating another one?"

Yeah I know, I just thought that it would be fun or interesting to document all the things I've done and learnt at work. It's nice to have some place that you can look back on the stupid mistakes you make and mock yourself.

##### "I think this is gonna die after 5 posts..."

WHY YOU NO TRUST IN ME?

But yeah.
